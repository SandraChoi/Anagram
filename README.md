# Anagram

An anagram is produced by rearranging the letters of one word or phrase to produce another word or phrase, e.g. "cat" and "act" are anagrams, “School master” an anagram of “The classroom”. 
Given a dictionary file ('words.txt') and a phrase with multiple words, this program genegrate all possible anagrams of the given phrase.
